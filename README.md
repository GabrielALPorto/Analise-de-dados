📊 Data Analysis Projects Repository

A collection of data analysis projects exploring various datasets using modern tools and techniques. This repository serves as my portfolio for data analysis, visualization, and insights extraction.
🗂️ Current Projects
1. Social Network Data Analysis social-data-analysis/

TypeScript and python-based synthetic social network data generator and analyzer

A project that generates realistic synthetic social network data for analysis purposes. The system mimics real social media platforms with users, posts, comments, and interactions.
🔧 Features:

    TypeScript implementation for type-safe data generation

    Synthetic data generation with realistic distributions

    User behavior simulation (posts, comments, likes, shares) - comming soon

    Network analysis (friend connections, influence metrics) - comming soon

    Time-series analysis of user activity patterns - comming soon

    Export capabilities for multiple formats (JSON, CSV) - comming soon

📈 Analysis Capabilities (comming soon):

    User engagement metrics and trends

    Content popularity analysis

    Network graph analysis and visualization

    Temporal patterns in user behavior

    Sentiment analysis simulation
